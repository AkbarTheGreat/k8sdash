# k8sdash
A kubernetes dashboard

The initial functionality of this will be to primarily to track newer releases of containers that are present in my cluster.  I also intend to have it quick-link to other pre-existing dashboards for myself.

A big part of this is a toy project to brush up on my Typescript and teach myself some of the more modern stuff, so the frontend and backend will be typescript.  This may or may not ever benefit anyone but me, but it's out there in case there's anything useful you can use.  I'm also happy to accept pull requests if you see a good general-purpose improvement.
